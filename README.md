### Adding New Modules
The project is designed to be modular. To add a new analysis module:
1. Create a new class that inherits from `CodeFetchModule`
2. Implement the required virtual functions:
   - `process_file(const fs::path& file_path)`
   - `print_stats() const`
3. Add your module to the main processing loop in `main.cpp`
